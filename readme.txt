This plugin provides a powerful user interface for creating post types, taxonomies, and meta boxes.

Add custom post types and taxonomies to your website without code. With the TypeRocket UI plugin, you can register advanced post types and advanced taxonomies without knowing any code.

2. Post type revision control.
3. Custom field column control for a post type's table view.
4. Remove the slug prefix from your post type.
